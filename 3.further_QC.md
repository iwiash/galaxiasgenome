Review coverage to see if purge_haplotigs isnt working right for some reason

```
samtools faidx purged.fa  # This generates a file called purged.fa.fai
```
creates index file for purged assembly

```
cut -f 1-2 purged.fa.fai > genome.txt
```
cut the first 2 cols of fa.fai to take the scaffold length and name > tab sep txt file

```
bedtools makewindows -g genome.txt -w 2000 > purged_genome_windows.bed
```
use makewindows to make windows frm txt file w lengths and scaffold names
This file will contain the windows of the genome. Each line will represent a window, specifying the chromosome (scaffold name), start position, and end position.
